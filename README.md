**An open-source alternative of Discord desktop's `app.asar`**

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**
>
> This fork of **OpenAsar** is specifically maintained to **tweak and optimize Discord's performance**,  
> aiming to **reduce micro-stuttering, frame drops, and inconsistent CPU scheduling** observed in the official build.  
>
> While it keeps full compatibility with the original OpenAsar project,  
> certain changes are experimental and focused on **performance tuning and stability under heavy usage**.  
>
> Use it at your own discretion — this version is **not officially supported by the OpenAsar team**.

## Features
- **:rocket: Startup Speed**: ~2x faster startup times (up to ~4x with experimental config)
- **:chart_with_upwards_trend: Performance**: OpenAsar can make your client feel snappier (scrolling, switching channels, etc)
- **:paintbrush: Splash Theming**: Easy theming for your splash which works with most themes for any client mod
- **:electric_plug: Drop-in**: Replace one file and it's installed, that's it (same with uninstall)
- **:gear: Configurable**: Adds many config options for Discord and OpenAsar enhancements (see config section)
- **:cloud: Lightweight**: <1% of Discord's original size (9mb -> ~50kb)
- **:shield: No Tracking**: Removes Discord's built-in tracking for crashes and errors in the asar (not app itself)
